# Topic : 1. Networking fundamentals (OSI & TCP/IP)

## üåê Networking Fundamentals (expanded)

### 1. **Models & Basics**

* OSI model (7 layers)
* TCP/IP model (4 layers)
* Data encapsulation & decapsulation
* Protocol Data Units (bits, frames, packets, segments)

---

### 2. **IP Addressing**

* IPv4 structure (network ID, host ID)
* IPv6 basics (why we needed it, structure)
* Subnetting (CIDR, subnet masks)
* Private vs public IPs
* NAT (Network Address Translation)

---

### 3. **Ports & Protocols**

* TCP vs UDP (handshake, reliability)
* Well-known ports (80/443 web, 22 SSH, 53 DNS, etc.)
* Common services: DNS, HTTP/S, FTP, SMTP, POP3/IMAP, SNMP
* Ephemeral/dynamic ports

---

### 4. **Routing & Switching**

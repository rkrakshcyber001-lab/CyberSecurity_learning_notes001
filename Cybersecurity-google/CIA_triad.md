# Use the CIA Triad to Protect Organizations

Previously, you were introduced to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad and how it helps organizations consider and mitigate risk. In this reading, you will learn how cybersecurity analysts use the CIA triad in the workplace. 

## The CIA Triad for Analysts
The CIA triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It is made up of three elements that cybersecurity analysts and organizations work toward upholding: **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**. Maintaining an acceptable level of risk and ensuring systems and policies are designed with these elements in mind helps establish a successful **security posture**, which refers to an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. 

### Confidentiality
Confidentiality is the idea that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.  
In an organization, confidentiality can be enhanced through the implementation of design principles, such as the **principle of least privilege**. The principle of least privilege limits users' access to only the information they need to complete work-related tasks. Limiting access is one way of maintaining the confidentiality and security of private data. 

### Integrity
Integrity is the idea that the data is **verifiably correct, authentic, and reliable**.  
Having protocols in place to verify the authenticity of data is essential. One way to verify data integrity is through **cryptography**, which is used to transform data so unauthorized parties cannot read or tamper with it. Another example is **encryption**, which converts data from a readable format to an encoded format. Encryption ensures that data, such as messages on an organization's internal chat platform, cannot be tampered with.  

### Availability
Availability is the idea that data is **accessible to those who are authorized to use it**.  
When a system adheres to both availability and confidentiality principles, data can be used when needed. For example, an organization may allow **remote employees** to access its internal network to perform their jobs. Access is still restricted based on role: an accounting department employee might need access to corporate accounts but not to ongoing development project data.  

## Key Takeaways
The CIA triad is essential for establishing an organization’s security posture.  
Knowing what it is and how it’s applied can help you better understand how security teams work to protect organizations and the people they serve.

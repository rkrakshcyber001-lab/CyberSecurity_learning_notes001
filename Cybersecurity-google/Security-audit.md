# Security Audits

## What is a Security Audit?
A **security audit** is an independent review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against internal and external criteria.

- **Internal criteria**: Policies, procedures, best practices  
- **External criteria**: Regulatory compliance, laws, federal regulations  

Audits assess established **security controls** (safeguards to reduce risks) and ensure checks are in place to detect threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
